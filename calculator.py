pseudocode

step 1: Define a function to  declare two variables a and b and  allow dynamic input by uses


step 2: Create functions called: addittion, multiplication, division, and subtraction  to perform any of the arithmetic operation

step 3: Crete a memo and ask user to choose operation to perform.

1 - Addition
2 - Subtraction
3 - Multiplication
4 - Division

step 4 : Print out result

step 5: Create variable 'repeat_operation' and assign it a boolean value of 'false'

step 6: Create another variable named controller_operation  and dynamically assign a value of '1' or '0', Asking "Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no) yes- press 1, No- press 0"

step 7: if controller_operation is equal to 1 then repeat_operation is set to true, 

ELSE IF repeat_operation is set to false
ELSE print "Enter a valid number " and end the program

step 8: while repeat_operation is equal to true repeat the following steps; 1 to 4.

step 9: while repeat_operation is equal to false print "Thank you for using our calculator" and end the program
